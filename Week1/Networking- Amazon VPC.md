> What did you learn from this lab?

- I learned about CloudFormation uploading the yaml file that create an ec2 instances. So that we cloud set up cloud watch and cloud watch logs. 
- Vpc and more automatically creates an internet gateway as opposed to just doing vpc only. The when you do create a new public subnet make sure you associate it with the internet gateway through editing its route tables. 
- When create Cloudwatch logs create group for the logs then the logs.
- I did forget how i did the VPC flow logs. I obviously remember it had something to do with cloudwatch. I don't remember how it was connected.
